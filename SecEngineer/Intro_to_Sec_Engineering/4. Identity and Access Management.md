# Identity and Access Management

## Introduction

What we'll see in this room are key concepts related to managing identities and authorization.

- How can we uniquely identify the different system users? **Identification**
- How can a user prove who they are to the system? **Authentication**
- How can we help prevent an attacker from pretending to be a legitimate user? **Strong password and Multi Factor Authentication**
- How can we decide what a user should access? How can we enforce such a decision? **Authorisation and Access Control**
- How can we know what a user is doing after logging in so that we can hold them accountable for their actions? **Logging and Auditing**

## IAAA

IAAA stands for:

1. Identity
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Accountability

### Identification

How a user (or process or system) claims a specific identity.

> In a party, if someone asks my name I will say that [my name is jeff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfIOBLr1NDU).

Identification can be through a username.
It can also be through a number (National ID, mobile phone number, passport number, etc).
The identification must be unique (two people can't have the same ID).

### Authentication

> But what if someone else claims to be me? In that case there must be a way to tell lies from truths...

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. This is accomplished through different ways:

1. Something you know (Password, passphrase, PIN, etc)
2. Something you have (Phone, security key)
3. Something you are (Biometric data)

Two more method exist though they are less used:

- Somewhere you are
- Something you do

**Multi Factor Authentication** refers to using two or more of the above mechanisms for increased security.

## Authorization and Access Control

If authentication states **who we are** authorization states **what we are allowed to do** (permissions/policies). While **Access Control** enforces these policies.

## Accountability and Logging

Accountability ensures that users can be held responsible for their actions. Accountability requires auditing capabilities, which in turn usually requires some form of logging.

### Logging

Logging is the process of recording events that occur within a system: user actions, system events, and errors.

Logging is vital for regulatory compliance, incident response, and forensic investigations.

Logging is critical and thus should be performed properly and securely. (Depending on the requirements) Logs should be tamper-proof.

**Log forwarding** is the process of sending log data from one system to another to protect it. This process often aggregates log data from multiple sources into a central location for more accessible analysis and management. Log forwarding can also be used to send log data to a cloud-based service for storage and analysis.

### Logging and SIEM

SIEM collects and analyzes log data from many sources to spot suspicious activity, detect potential incidents, and alert security teams. When organizations integrate strong logging with SIEM, they gain better visibility into system and network activity, which improves their ability to identify and respond to threats. This integration also supports compliance by generating audit-ready reporting data, and it helps forensic investigations by preserving a detailed history of activity to trace the source and cause of incidents.

## Identity Management (IdM vs IAM)

**IdM (Identity Management)** is mainly about **the identity itself**: creating, maintaining, and storing digital identities (users/devices) and their attributes (e.g., name, role, department), plus the basics of authentication and permissions management.

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is broader: it includes IdM, but adds **how access decisions are made and enforced across the organization**—and how that access is governed over time.

### Practical differences:

* **Focus**

  * **IdM:** “Who is the user/device?” and “What identity data and entitlements do they have?”
  * **IAM:** “Should they get access right now to this resource?” and “How is access controlled, monitored, and reviewed?”

* **Scope**

  * **IdM:** Identity lifecycle and identity repository (create/update/disable identities, manage attributes/groups).
  * **IAM:** Everything in IdM **plus** access control mechanisms (RBAC/ABAC), MFA, SSO, policy enforcement, governance, auditing, and compliance workflows.

* **Typical capabilities**

  * **IdM:** User provisioning/deprovisioning, directory services, account management, basic authentication/authorization data.
  * **IAM:** SSO, MFA, role/attribute-based access control, access requests/approvals, periodic access reviews, logging/auditing, compliance reporting.

A simple way to remember it:

* **IdM = managing identities**
* **IAM = managing identities + managing and governing access**

## Access Control Models

A system controls access to various resources based on the chosen mode.

### Discretionary Access Control

Access to objects is controlled by the object’s owner (or someone the owner authorizes). The owner can grant or revoke permissions (e.g., read/write/execute) to other users, typically using ACLs or permission bits.

Example: In Unix/Linux file permissions, the owner of a file can use chmod/ACLs to decide who can read or edit it. In cloud storage (Google Drive/Dropbox), the file owner chooses who can view/comment/edit.

### Role-Based Access Control

Each user has one or more roles or functional positions; furthermore, they are authorised to access different resources based on their roles (like, how in Linux you can add people to groups).

### Mandatory Access Control

An access control model where the operating system enforces a centrally defined security policy over all subjects and objects within the system boundary. Access decisions are based on labels/rules set by security administrators, and users (including resource owners) cannot override or alter the policy. [AppArmor](https://www.apparmor.net/) and SELinux are an examples of MAC in Linux.

## Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On (SSO) lets users authenticate once (typically via a central Identity Provider) and then access multiple approved systems without logging in again for each one.
Advantages: centralized enforcement of MFA (often configured at the IdP), reduced password fatigue and helpdesk resets, and improved efficiency since users don’t repeatedly re-authenticate.

One example of SSO is the typical "Sign in with Google"
